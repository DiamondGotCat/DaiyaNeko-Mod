## Notes
1. If you create a world with the mod installed, you will get a warning. This warning is due to Minecraft applying the data packs that are in this mod.
2. The warning in point 1 is that if you have no other mods in the game, this mod is recognized as an experimental feature. You can use elements of this mod by creating a world as is.
3. When you exit a world and enter a world a second time, you will get a warning similar to the warning in Note 1. In this case, too, follow the instructions in Note 2.
4. The developer cannot be held responsible (and cannot be held liable) for any problems caused by this mod.
5. Most of the elements of this mod were created from the suggestions of my diamond cat friends.
6. This mod was made with game balance in mind, but some people may find the game balance broken. It is recommended to use separate save data.
7. This page will be updated in the future. Please remember that precautions may change.
